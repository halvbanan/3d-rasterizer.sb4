# 3d-rasterizer.sb4
a rasterizer in smilebasic 4 written from scratch using a bunch of ARYOPs, very slow since the latest version of smilebasic(smilebasic 4.4.9) unfortunately doesn't support 3d rendering, so i made my own, i do have a physically based renderer but i am clueless about licensing the implementation so i chose my older engine instead, sorry
